I have made a very basic one due to an unfortunate time conflict of my ofice matter as its a working day and its hard to block 4 hours of time on a woking day.

The basic api just adds and fetches info by per farm. Inside are lot of complex models. 
Kindly see the document attached to find screenshots of working code using Postman.

Given some more time I would be able to add the basic UI using thyme leaf and also would do a Select all by farm name to check the actual comparison.

The api is based out from Swagger URL by design. Hence a bit complex. Out of practice I could not think of a very simple structure that oook even more time. These are not excuses. But hope this would help you understand that none of the code is copied from anywhere and its a functioning code from scratch. This would give you an idea that I do hands on coding more often than a regular manager.
